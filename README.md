For train and training with the states being in numpy, use "main.py" and "trade_env_numpy.py". For training  with ray, use "main_ray.py" and "trade_env_ray.py"

Then use "main_test_results.py" and "test_trade_env_numpy.py" for both training. The testing is always done in numpy. 
In the "main_test_results.py", adapt the directory of your folder for checkpoints.
